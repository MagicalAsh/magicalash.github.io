						<h2>Battleship</h2>
						<p>
                            Battleship was the final project of the Networking Course
                            at Western Carolina. The goal was to create a multiplayer
                            networked version of the game Battleship, capable of managing
                            several players at once. The final product was a client and
                            server using Threads, Sockets, the Observer pattern, and several
                            other tools to make the project function.

								<h3>Tools Used</h3>
							    <p>
                                    Battleship was written using Java, and dealt
                                    with thread usage, the observer pattern, and
                                    several other useful patterns and concepts
                                    within the field of networking.
