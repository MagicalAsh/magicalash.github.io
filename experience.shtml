                                <p>
                                    The summer of 2018 was spent working with Eric Bourn
                                    of the SAS Viya mid-tier platform on improving the
                                    tracability of the SAS Viya platform. I worked with
                                    the Spring Framework, the Zipkin tracing service,
                                    Jira, Docker, and several other enterprise tools.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My project was to implement Zipkin within the SAS Viya
                                    platform to allow for microservice calls to be traced
                                    across the platform. This included finding and fixing 
                                    a bug which prevented proper tracing, finding a deadlock
                                    caused by an interaction between the Zipkin tracing implementation
                                    and the Spring architecture, and building a set of tools
                                    to enable tracing of database calls and other internal,
                                    non-microservice calls.

                                    My undergraduate experience as a Computer Science
                                    and Mathematics major led me to find my passions
                                    within the fields of software development and
                                    data-driven analytics.
